# Innovative-Fintech-Solutions-Enhancing-the-Mortgage-Experience

## Overview and Origin 
Founded in 2013 by Joseph Fooks, Mortgage Automator originated as a simple tool designed for a small lender in Toronto, Canada, aiming to streamline daily operations and facilitate business growth. Initially intended to assist with daily tasks, its popularity surged within the industry, prompting widespread adoption beyond its initial scope. Since its inception, Mortgage Automator has undergone substantial growth and transformation. By 2019, it had transcended its origins as a mere document tool, receiving notable recognition by winning a prestigious industry award. Continuously improving, the platform regularly introduces new features to enhance its functionalities. At its core, Mortgage Automator utilizes fintech innovations to empower lenders to manage their work effectively. It is a comprehensive solution, handling document management, regulatory compliance, and tracking the various stakeholders involved in the lending process. Joseph Fooks, the founder, initiated JV Capital in 2013 with an initial funding capital of a few hundred thousand dollars. The company's financial backing swiftly expanded to a couple of million dollars, facilitating the growth and development of Mortgage Automator.

## Business Activities
The primary financial challenge tackled by the company involves the inefficiencies inherent in manual preparation of documentation, deal tracking, and ensuring accurate calculations in the lending business.
“I think the issue was that we didn’t have a proper foundation to go out and raise capital. The people with real money that wanted to invest in loans didn’t look at us seriously because we weren’t set up properly. We couldn’t show them investor statements, we didn’t have the information at our fingertips when they called. Once we implemented the software, it allowed us to go out there and bring in much more capital.”
Lawrence Schwartz   Co-Owner & President, JV Capital
By automating these processes, the company enables faster collaboration on real-time document creation and distribution. This automation liberates teams to concentrate on cultivating relationships, securing more deals, and dedicating time to marketing and investor acquisition. The goal is to enhance efficiency by automating routine tasks, redirecting efforts toward business development. Features include auto-generation of custom documents, compliance reports, and payment processes, alongside streamlined communication with involved parties. Ultimately, the focus remains on running and expanding private lending operations.
The company's intended customers are people or businesses in the lending industry, like private lenders, banks, and mortgage brokers. These are the folks involved in lending money or managing mortgages. The product they offer helps these customers automate tasks related to lending, like making documents and handling compliance. It's meant to make their work easier and more efficient.

Mortgage Automator works with Filogix to connect their platforms securely. When brokers using Filogix send deals to lenders on Mortgage Automator, all the deal details appear automatically in the lender's Automator account. This helps lenders manage these deals easily.
Automator users get emails about new deals and can create necessary paperwork quickly. These files can then be sent back to the broker using Filogix.
This direct sharing of files helps lenders work faster, which is Mortgage Automator's main goal. It ensures that lenders keep getting broker applications, letting them focus on growing their business smoothly.

In the lending tech industry, companies use specific measures to see how well they're doing:
First up, they watch how much money they're lending out. More lending often means more business is happening.
They're into customers - tracking how many new ones they get and if they stick around. It tells them if people like what they're offering.
Financially, they're comparing costs against earnings and trying to be more efficient.
They want to process loan requests fast. Speed matters for customers waiting for loans.
They're careful about loan quality, like avoiding late payments or defaults.
Seeing how much users like and use new tools is important too. If people find them useful, that's a win.
Lastly, following rules and managing risks is crucial for them to stay safe and legal.

We're aiming to reach out to folks with lower incomes by focusing our marketing efforts on them. At the same time, we're thinking about investing some of our profits into cryptocurrencies, but we're aware it's risky – it could pay off big time or lead to losses.
We're also exploring an interesting idea – using a map to find areas where properties are sitting idle. The plan is to target these property owners with our marketing but without using their properties as collateral for loans.
We think these strategies could help us expand our customer base and attract new clients. However, we're also being cautious and making sure we're playing by the rules and considering the possible risks involved in each step.
The proposed strategies aim to diversify and expand the company's market reach by targeting lower-income individuals, exploring cryptocurrency investments, and engaging unused property owners for financial services without property collateral. These strategies could attract new customers, differentiate the company, and demonstrate innovation.

considering using data tools to understand and categorize individuals with lower incomes, aiming for personalized assistance and focused advertising. Moreover, we're contemplating cryptocurrency technology for potential investments in digital currencies such as Bitcoin.
Our strategy involves utilizing mapping and analysis tools to pinpoint areas with unused properties for targeted marketing initiatives.
